  "I did not build meUus because the world needed another app. I built it because I watched too many people — brilliant, honest, hardworking people — drift through life without a map. Without someone to tell them where they are strong. Without a system that sees them as whole human beings, not productivity units.",
  "meUus is not a startup. It is a commitment. A commitment to every soul that has ever been told they were not enough, that their circumstances define them, that their dreams are too big for their reality. We reject that. Completely.",
  "This ecosystem began in the quiet spaces — between a legal chamber and a classroom, between a grocery delivery route and a greenhouse in the early morning. It began with the belief that truth, when structured with care, becomes power. That power, when shared, becomes justice.",
  "We are building three things simultaneously, but in order: cashflow to survive, pilots to prove, and a digital system to scale. This discipline is not caution. It is respect — respect for the people who depend on us, the families whose property seeds this mission, and the communities who will carry it forward.",
  "The Deep Life Assessment System — DLAS — is the soul of this work. It is not a test. It is a mirror. Five levels of structured truth across your past, your present, and your future. It tells you where you are, not to judge you, but to guide you. And it will only work if you enter it with radical honesty.",
  "Nine pillars stand behind the platform. Legal truth. Business growth. Mental clarity. Work with dignity. Family harmony. Green livelihood. Ideas made real. Recovery for those who have been broken. And aLive Bangladesh — the media voice that tells our own stories, in our own words, to our own people.",
  "I am asking for something from everyone who joins: not your money first, but your truth. Your willingness to be assessed, to be guided, to be held accountable, and to hold others accountable in return. meUus is a mutual contract between souls. It only works if we all show up.",
  "To the founding members reading this: you are not early adopters. You are co-authors. The legal chambers, the greenhouses, the classrooms, the delivery routes, the assessment sheets — these are your inheritance. Build them with the same care you would build for your own family. Because in the end, that is exactly what we are.",
  "We launch on 21 July 2026. Not because the work will be finished by then, but because the work must begin. There will never be a perfect moment. There is only this moment, and our decision to meet it with courage.",
  "I will leave you with the only promise I can make: meUus will never be sold. The portion of my family's property dedicated to this mission will remain dedicated. The mission will outlive any individual, including me. We are building a cathedral, not a company. And cathedrals take generations.",
