              This document represents the inaugural case of meUus — a holistic
              life-support ecosystem designed to address interconnected human
              challenges across legal, financial, mental, relational, and
              spiritual dimensions.

              Client #001 is unique: he is both the founder and the first
              service recipient. This dual role provides unparalleled
              authenticity to the meUus model. His public disclosure of profound
              personal struggle — loneliness, unresolved relationships,
              financial instability, and existential questioning — became the
              catalyst for activating the very system he designed.

                Core Philosophy Statement:
              </strong>{" "}
              The founder articulates a theological-philosophical framework
              wherein "sex" (the biological act of procreation) and "life"
              (existence itself) are fundamentally interconnected. Just as
              sexual union generates biological life, the union of body
              (physical/material) and soul (divine will / hukum of Allah)
              generates conscious human existence. This dual nature — being
              simultaneously physical beings (from Adam's soil) and spiritual
              beings (from Allah's command) — creates the essential human
              condition that meUus addresses.

          <P>
            When I did!! No one responded!! They didn't even bother about me &
            my relations, my responsibilities. They didn't justify anything
            ever, and the most saddest part!!? They never ever even tried to
            ask for the truth! The clarification!!!
          </P>
          <P>Who was I!</P>
          <P>What I did!!</P>
          <P>
            They forgot about my participation in their life! My attempted
            actions...
          </P>
          <P>They forgot everything...</P>
          <P>
            Even they have never tried to remember & give a simple reply in
            words!!
          </P>
          <P>I came to a point!!</P>
          <P>
            They didn't think, don't feel like I'm human. Although everything or
            anything — I have that right & by-born rights in every aspect of
            life. Whether I'm a devil or a 2-faced person, or someone who
            pretends good but inside is full empty... Even that. I have the
            right to speech & the right to choose & live according to my own
            path. The full responsibility is mine & I totally accept it.
          </P>
          <P>
            This was about me or many like me. But what about the one who calls
            himself educated! The one who is taking the decisions!! The man who
            thinks better than me or us!! What about them!
          </P>
          <P>Good people... And people follow blindly...</P>
          <P>
            And the bad people!! Who came with the fucking bad, frustrated,
            brutal truth!!?
          </P>
          <P>
            I'm talking to those!! The word "responsibility" is stuck!!
          </P>
          <P>
            It's a true fact! You should give yourself time to examine... To
            consult the inner true self that's telling you: you are misguiding
            your inner soul by doing that.
          </P>
          <P>You know, but you pretend you don't.</P>
          <P>
            You're telling a lie or doing wrong or injustice & you know that, &
            yet you're justifying that you are right!
          </P>
          <P>
            Like I'm telling a lie about someone — that he never speaks with
            honesty like me or us!
          </P>
          <P>
            People just accept it as it is & feel like "whatever..."
          </P>

          <PullQuote>
            I will never show you my inner! You will never ever get a word from
            me... 🖤
          </PullQuote>

          <P>
            This is not a curse! Or a punishment or revenge... It's full of
            respect. It's honor...
          </P>
          <P>Because I'm still in love with you... 🖤</P>
          <P>
            To the one I loved once! And said it one time ever in our life
            together! Or then we had a fucking fight or silent departure from
            each other's lives, from time!
          </P>
          <P>
            And my love will remain forever the same — like the love at first
            exploration...
          </P>
          <P>You know! I never ever took leave... Always I was by your side...</P>
          <P>
            Not a single action can you ever truly, justifiably point to where I
            had the ability & I didn't help you in the time we explored
            together...
          </P>
          <P>And see the return for asking, fuck!</P>
          <P>Oh, and also create a print in your mind, in your thoughts:</P>
          <P>
            The pattern, the circumstances, the time or period of need & asking
            & demand & everything — the dedication level, the intention, the
            one begging to YOU who never said no to you unless there was an
            exception. And as we know, exception is not an example!
          </P>
          <P>
            We both lived the same time altogether & we both know the actual
            truth! So we both should have kept the minimum honor or value for
            that — because time never comes back, but memories do... Truth will
            remain unchanged. Truth is not something presentable to see or
            read — it's something and everything about finding, thinking,
            justifying, accepting, and providing honesty.
          </P>
          <P>For this, no one has to be educated or intelligent or a pious good human:</P>
          <P>
            You just need a true intention to accept the truth and accept the
            circumstances & apologize if you did wrong & have the feeling "I
            shouldn't have done this" & "I should TRY to understand this so I
            never ever do the same again" — with the intention to never repeat
            it, even if you know somehow you might slip into the same trap
            again!
          </P>
          <P>That's the minimum...</P>
          <P>So do it right now...</P>
          <P>Who created us! Knows anything and everything...</P>
          <P>
            And we, all believers, will be asked: "What did you do with what I
            gave you!" No hiding! And only the Hereafter is hidden...

          <PullQuote>We are trapped. No one remains human.</PullQuote>

          <P>
            Negligence has occupied human action. We have already taken steps on
            a devil's path through neglect... Neglect is a form of disrespect,
            and this is not similar to belief unless or until we accept the
            truth. And believers like us have failed to act and pretend and
            live like believers. We note out facts or truths, then mix them by
            saying "bro, it's reality..." Something like... theoretical
            knowledge vs experiential reality.
          </P>
          <P>
            We're getting knowledge by saying & thinking it's true & for
            execution! But we are changing it with what we call "reality!!"
          </P>
          <P>So! What is belief & the believer itself!?</P>
          <P>
            Not only that — we are then misguiding others by not maintaining a
            simple, true, accepted nature & overall good intention for ourselves
            and for others as the same creation of the same Creator!
          </P>
          <P>
            The intention is what matters — whether you have anything more or
            less...
          </P>
          <P>
            I really wanted to be a true human being, a true believer, &
            sometimes I tried & sometimes I pretended & sometimes I failed — but
            every time I tried! I tried & started with a pure intention...

            I lost myself... When & how many times I found myself in those
            moments! Lost fact! I experienced. Per experience, some extra
            lines! Discover. Add. Realize. I just accept & get submitted
            towards God, the true Creator. That doesn't mean I'm good or
            religious or something like that. I'm just a human like any other
            human. And I accept that.

            On Creation, Life, and the Body-Soul Duality

            <p>
              In this section, the founder uses the word "sex" in two distinct
              ways:
            </p>
            <ol className="ml-5 list-decimal space-y-2">
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">
                  Sex as biological procreation
                </strong>{" "}
                — the literal act that generates new human life.
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong className="text-foreground">
                  "Sex" as metaphor for "life" itself
                </strong>{" "}
                — because without sexual union, no life is generated in the
                seen/physical world.
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              He further explains that just as sex (male + female union)
              creates biological life, the union of body (Adam's soil /
              physical) + soul (Allah's will / Hukum) creates conscious human
              existence. We are "mixed of two" — and this duality is
              fundamental to understanding the human condition.

          <SubHeading>The Creation Story</SubHeading>

          <P>
            God announced before the creation of Insaan (humanity) as Adam (AS)
            — as human, as the Greatest and Most Honored — with knowledge which
            was shown to the Angels! By addressing them! & By telling them all
            the names! (To justify the names or meanings)
          </P>
          <P>After that! What is the reality!</P>
          <P>
            By time, a feeling was discovered for humankind called Loneliness...
            Feeling alone, a desire for something!
          </P>
          <P>
            Even I don't know — I didn't find anywhere — in that moment, what
            the thinking was or what Adam was doing or if he asked Allah to
            create this and that for him to cover the loneliness... Or what!
          </P>
          <P>Allah created Woman.</P>
          <P>Wow! The man just found his "wo"! 😅😂🤣</P>
          <P>Just sex! I mean! Same life!</P>
          <P>Allah pulled someone I didn't know & made her different.</P>
          <P>
            He created us to go throughout sex! 🫣 The most demanding &
            enjoyable experience — going throughout this is life itself, to
            create another life to continue...
          </P>

          <Callout label="In my talks with various kinds of people">
            <p>
              Someone said: If the sex is good [not about duration, penis size,
              or anything physical] then it's okay — you can manage with
              one-time sex and one-time hunger (meaning food)...
            </p>
            <p>
              But if it's bad! [Not about duration] [About understanding]
              [About the guidelines provided] Then no matter how much sex you
              have, how much time, how much wealth, fame, or whatever you have
              (24 hours 😅🤣 although not possible) — even 24 hours of sex
              won't fulfill the life.
            </p>
            <p>
              Just think like me: A life is missing from a life... How
              pathetic! 🤣😅😂
            </p>
          </Callout>

          <P>So the takeaway is:</P>
          <P>
            Allah announced the greatest creation — Adam as Man, as Human — and
            human life itself is the greatest creation.
          </P>
          <P>
            From that man, Adam — another was created, called Woman — from
            within that man — to change the emptiness or loneliness, to bring
            these feelings, to create life from life.
          </P>
          <P>
            Then sex as life-fulfilling satisfaction is presented for another
            life to go through, within the greatest feelings in humanity.
          </P>
          <P>Are we on track or not!? So!? Where were we! Now!?</P>

          <SubHeading>The Reality of Impurity and Purity</SubHeading>

          <P>
            The sperm! It's also life! 😅 Were we — one of our many potential
            lives — dead before we got life!? 😅😂🤣
          </P>
          <P>
            🤐 The rules of ejaculation from the body part 😅 make a human
            impure.
          </P>
          <P>
            The moment of satisfaction happens — the moment finishes, khatam,
            tata, bye-bye — and before "farz ghusl" (obligatory bath), you have
            to properly maintain the proper purification rules.
          </P>
          <P>
            Even... (0.0001%) lack of intention & confidence with those
            purification guidelines! You remain impure!
          </P>
          <P>
            You can't touch the Quran... As the Quran is sent for men, but he
            can't touch it because of life-making...
          </P>
          <P>
            No one can enter the mosque in that moment of impure body until
            purification is completed...
          </P>
          <P>Can you imagine!? Is this relatable!?</P>
          <P>Even more:</P>
          <P>This is the fact. The truth.</P>
          <P>I didn't want anything.</P>
          <P>Even God didn't ask me before creation.</P>
          <P>But it happened. God's Will.</P>
          <P>Nothing, no one can change it... Only God's Will...</P>

          {/* PART III */}
          <PartDivider numeral="III" title="The Comprehensive Guidelines" />

          <P>
            Allah gave us Comprehensive Guidelines & the way & example through
            Prophet Muhammad (SAW) — the Quran & Sunnah.
          </P>
          <P>
            Many followed, many didn't, and it's a continuing process...
          </P>
          <P>Many failed just before dying...</P>
          <P>
            Many passed away just before dying, but their full life was full
            of... whatever...
          </P>
          <P>
            That means it's God's Will. But then why the punishment & why the
            rewards!
          </P>
          <P>
            If nothing changes for Allah — Allah is Allah whether the whole
            creation agrees or not, whether they honor Him or not — nothing
            changes for the Creator Himself.
          </P>
          <P>What's the point!?</P>

          <SubHeading>The Story of Iblis (The Devil)</SubHeading>

          <P>
            The most knowledgeable creation — one of the Jinn called the
            Devil — the most honored of all the Jinn and Angels, their Leader.
          </P>
          <P>
            No place is found on earth or above that doesn't worship Allah.
          </P>
          <P>
            But neglect happened in the act... It starts within the inner self
            — which only Allah can see.
          </P>
          <P>
            Step by step, by this — and by not taking steps against it within
            the inner self! — the full poisoning was completed! Done.
          </P>
          <P>So what's the theory & what's the reality!</P>
          <P>It's intention first — for all and everything...</P>
          <P>
            Allah didn't create creation first by giving the order "Kun" (Be),
            and then it became...
          </P>
          <P>
            The Creator first created the Pen and commanded it to write
            everything — from the first creation to everything until the end.
            The book is closed! Done.
          </P>
          <P>No action can change it. It's done.</P>
          <P>
            So Allah knows whether I'm going to Hell or Heaven — and that's the
            Will of Allah, whether He helps us by giving mercy or not, and it
            depends in a professional manner... Contextually relevant...
